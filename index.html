                        <p>GCBot is a Discord bot made with the discord.py library. It is designed to be completely modular and extremely easy to set up and use. 
                            All functionality comes from the plugins, meaning you decide what you want your bot to do. 
                            Know some Python? Our plugin system is incredibly simple, so you can start adding custom commands to your bot right away! This bot was made by 
                            <a href="http://github.com/monkeycapers">Evan Jesty</a> and <a href="http://github.com/ryanlyrl">Ryan Ly</a>.</p>

                            <p><b>Why did you make this bot?</b></p>
                            <p>This bot is created by two students as an attempt to put our skills to use for something that we would be able to use everyday. In the end, we found that we liked having full control over how the bot works, and eventually we polished it up enough for a release.</p>
